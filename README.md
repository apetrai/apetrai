### A 13 year old C++ developer
I currently live in London, currently in secondary education. 
I started coding since the beginning of 2021 and have been enjoying it since then. 
I really like learning, especially when it comes to coding.
I started learning C++ as my first language and I'm still continuing learning it today.
