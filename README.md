### Angelo Petrai
#### 13 year old C++ and Web developer.

I started coding at the beginning of 2021 for the first week I started on C# but then changed to C++, I completely forgot everything I learned for C# so it doesn't count as one of my skills. I am interested also in Mathematics and Physics, it has really fascinated me of how much humanity has advanced and relies on technology more and more as we age as a species.
